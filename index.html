# Green Infrastructure Suitability Analysis - Kearny, New Jersey

The students of the Coastal Resiliency Studio at the The Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy of Rutgers University worked with the Town of Kearny, New Jersey to better understand how precipitation events threatened the town and what measures the town could take to protect its infrastructure, mitigate urban flooding, and reduce combined sewer overflow events. 

Urban flooding from extreme precipitation events represents a threat to communities in New Jersey, both coastal and inland. Additionally, historical urban development – in fluvial floodplains, on top of streams that we’ve buried underground – creates greater problems today, as storms like these become more frequent due to climate change. And all too often, the neighborhoods of communities that tend to suffer these consequences are disproportionately those that have been historically marginalized, those with lower incomes, and communities of color. But communities are not helpless to let these events continue to wreak havoc. One way that urban flooding from extreme precipitation can be managed is through green infrastructure. Mainly used in communities today to prevent polluted stormwater runoff from reaching waterways, green infrastructure can be an important tool to reduce and even prevent urban flooding from affecting neighborhoods in areas at greatest risk. Using green infrastructure in this way requires planning, and that is what the studio explored for Kearny. 

Our two goals in siting green infrastructure in Kearny are to prevent flooding and to reduce the amount of stormwater entering the sewer system so that combined sewer overflow (CSO) events are reduced. To determine the most suitable sites for green infrastructure in Kearny, we conducted a suitability analysis using the mapping software ArcGIS Pro. Using this tool, we were able to incorporate a variety of criteria which would determine the effectiveness of green infrastructure throughout the Uplands in Kearny. The entirety of the Uplands was evaluated at a 10x10 foot resolution.

The four criteria used in the suitability analysis were:
